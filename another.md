### Closures
A closure is ability of function to remember its surrounding.
e.g.

    function parent() {
        let x = 5
        let y = function(a) {
            return x+a;
        }
        return y    // note that a function is being returned
    }

    let myFunc = parent()

    // note since y is being returned into myFunc so calling myFunc will invoke y.
    // But now y is returned OUT of parent what happens to the x since it was availabe only in parent function?

    myFunc(3)   // this returns 8 as answer. 
    
    // The value of x is remembered by the retured function y since it is in its CLOSURE (i.e its immidiate environment that it remembers)

Note: "remember" simply means that every time a function is returned a new copy of variables in its environment is created and maintained by js and stays attached to the function as a "Closure"


Now a more formal defination will be : A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.
